## A Successful Project

* For my project I wanted to be able to explore a virtual room/world from a first person viewpoint. I created a room programmatically out of blocks (just a 3 dimensional array of boxes very much like minecraft). I created a camera class that would calculate the view matrix for me based on the position of the player and direction that player was looking. I added spheres that "bounced" around the room and could be shot with the player's gun. I had three dynamic lights that could be moved and "shot out" causing the room to go dark. Basically I made a first person experience in which the player could explore a room and interact with objects and lights in that room.

## Other Possibilities

* Load some 3d image into a program that allows you to use keyboard keys to navigate the object in the file. For example, hitting left would rotate the object counter-clockwise around the vertical axis, and hitting up or down would rotate it over the horizontal axis. Any 3d file format will do so long as the format is open enough to be workable. I would suggest a file from Blender, a 3d animation system.
* Animate a shadow coming off of a ball as the light source moves in some predictable pattern; simpler, but more realistic.
* Create a 3d scene through which a user may navigate the camera by using keyboard keys to indicate movement and the mouse to indicate angular rotation about the camera's current center.
* Make a 3D soccer game. Basic game instructions with basic models.

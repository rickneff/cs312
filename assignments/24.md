Assignment 24 - Drawing Spheres
===============================
Show your ability to create complex procedurally generated tesselated 3D geometry by creating a 3D sphere.

## Requirements

* Use the lat/lon method discussed in class.
* Build the colors of the sphere such that the red and green components of the color match the uv coordinates we will give them when we apply a texture map.
* Start with a simple scene and just draw a spinning cube (since you have one of those) to make sure your scene is correct.
* Refer to [the included example](24).

## Self-Assessment

* I attempted to make a simple scene to test my sphere with it spinning on its axis.
* I attempted to make a function to create a sphere that took the number of latitudes and longitudes.
* I attempted to make the vertex list and index list to draw the necessary triangles.
* I attempted to create the colors on the vertices to match the uv maps we will be applying.
* I understand the code and how to debug it if there were any problems.
* My code builds without compile-time errors.
* My code runs without runtime errors.

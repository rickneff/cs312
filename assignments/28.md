Assignment 28 - Lighting Part 2 - Diffuse And Ambient
=====================================================
Extend your previous assignments to include a position of a light source in 3D.

## Requirements

* Determine the amount of diffuse lighting on each fragment by using the dot product.
* Do something interesting with the ambient and diffuse light, like perhaps modulate the colors you are getting with a "light color" that is passed in.
* Refer to [the included example](28), where two images are used, one for the ambient light (the dark side with lights), and one for diffuse light.

## Self-Assessment

* I was able to pass in my light position as a uniform and convert it to view space.
* I found a varying vector that represents the unit vector to the light source.
* I found the amount of diffuse light using a dot product.
* I found something interesting to do with diffuse and ambient light (1 - the diffuse value) which required me sending in some more uniforms.
* I understand the code and I am able to debug it.
* My code runs without errors or warnings that I am aware of.

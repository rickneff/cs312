Assignment 27 - Lighting Part 1 - Vertex Normals
================================================
Get a start on the lighting assignments by being able to pass in vertex normals for your models in your shaders and make a simple diffuse shader.

## Requirements

* Create vertex normals for at least a sphere (easy!) and perhaps more.
* Refer to [the included example](27).

## Self-Assessment

* I made my objects provide unit vectors for each vertex.
* My shader has an attribute for the vertex normal.
* I was able to bind to the attribute in my shader and pass in my own array buffers for the vertex normal.
* I provided some uniform value that my vertex shader could use to determine the unit length vector in view space.
* I determined the unit vector for the normal in view space and passed that along as a varying value.
* I tested to make sure my normals we coming through to my fragment shader by giving my fragments a false color based on the normal positions.
* I multiplied the color value by some aspect of the normal (say, the x value) to make a first stab at what the diffuse shader might look like.
* I understand the code and I am able to debug the code and the shaders effectively.
* My code runs without any warnings or errors that I am aware of.

Assignment 18 - Depth Buffering
===============================
Extend your previous assignment to include the capability of depth buffering.

## Requirements

* Refer to the [index.html](18/ifiles/index.html) file.
* Make it render like the [depthbuffering.png](18/ifiles/depthbuffering.png) image.

## Self-Assessment

* I created a test that would check my depth buffer against lines and triangles (or I used those supplied).
* I kept some kind of memory buffer in my render buffer to store depth values and initialized the values to something that would not fail the first time it was checked.
* I changed my setPixel function to pass in a depth value and compared that to the depth buffer before drawing pixels.
* I passed in the depth values when I use drawPoints.
* I passed in the depth values when I draw lines.
* I passed in depth values when I fill triangles.
* I used Z values rather than W values, so it should still work even in Orthographic Projections.
* In interpolating the depth values, I do still find t values the same way I did for w values and varying values.

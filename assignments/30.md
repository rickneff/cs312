Assignment 30 - Transparency
============================
Include transparency in your scene by including blending and alpha channels.

## Requirements

* Do something interesting with your transparency (e.g., use a texture map or at least provide a uniform).
* Refer to [the included example](30), which now has a cloud layer that is transparent.
* Notice in the example that a single shader is used, but something sneaky has to be done when the texture is not there.

## Self-Assessment

* I turned blending on with a suitable blend function.
* When dealing with transparency, I was careful to turn depth culling off and draw things in the correct order, opaque at first (perhaps with depth culling on), then transparency layers from back to front.
* I was able to send in my transparency values effectively with a uniform (either as a texture or something else interesting).
* I understand the code and I am able to debug it.
* My code runs without warnings, errors, or bugs that I am aware of.

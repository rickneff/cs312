Assignment 17 - Triangle Clipping
=================================
Extend your previous assignments to clip triangles at the 6 clip planes.

## Requirements

* Refer to the [index.html](17/ifiles/index.html) file.
* Make it render like the [triangleclipping.png](17/ifiles/triangleclipping.png) image.
* Note two new functions used in the index.html test file.

## Self-Assessment

* I made a really good start on the assignment.
* My code runs without compile errors.
* I used the 6 clip planes that should work with an Orthographic or Perspective Projection.
* I left my check in Render Buffer so that it would yell at me if I let my triangles run out of bounds.
* My triangles appear to be clipping correctly.
* The lines in this example also seem to be clipping correctly.

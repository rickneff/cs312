Assignment 13 - Triangles Part 2
================================
Extend your code from Triangles Part 1 (Assignment 12) to fill the triangles with a smooth gradient.

## Requirements

* Make it look like the [filled.png](13/ifiles/filled.png) image.
* Use the "scan line" method described in class.
* Fix the bug in drawing when the middle point is to the left of the long line.

## Self-Assessment

* I think I have a pretty good understanding of what we were doing in class and I took a stab at it in code.
* I have code that sorts the three points of my triangle, and I have done a test to make sure it works.
* I was able to determine if the middle point was to the left of the long line or to the right of the long line.
* I have a test with triangles in both orientations, as well as a triangle that looks completely V or ^  (2 of the vertices have the same Y value, either the ones on the top V or the ones on the bottom ^).
* I was able to get a consistent fill in my triangle, with code that runs cleanly.
* I did my own line intersections to draw the fill AND I have an interesting example of a case where it looks strange OR I was able to use my line drawing function to get the proper inner values for the fill.

Assignment 19 - GLSL Development Environment
============================================
Get started in your own development experience.

## Requirements

* Find an online resource, a tutorial or whatever, that gets you started with an OpenGL context using the Windowing environment, language, and development tools of your choice.
* Implement the example code that you see there.
* Be sure to find and implement an example that uses vertex and fragment shaders in OpenGL.
* Just get something working and visible for you, even if you don't really understand all of it.
* Be prepared to show off your example(s) in class.

Here is [a link to the WebGL example](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/webgl-essentials-part-i--net-25856) from class.

## Self-Assessment

* I found a resource that can help me get started in my graphics development of choice.
* My example code uses vertex shaders and fragment shaders.
* I was able to get the example code working.
* I like my development environment and language (because I picked it), and I won't whine too much about it. :-)

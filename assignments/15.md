Assignment 15 - Perspective Projection Part 2
=============================================
Complete the perspective projection.

## Requirements

* Refer to the [index.html](15/ifiles/index.html) file.
* Make it render like the [persproj2.png](15/ifiles/persproj2.png) image.
* Accurately derive the interpolation for the varying values (colors) when dealing with depth.

## Self-Assessment

* I took an honest shot at the assignment.
* My code compiles cleanly.
* I am able to get the correct gradient in place for a line that has end-points with different Z values.
* Lines that have end-points with the SAME Z value still have a linear gradation.
* My triangle OUTLINES that have points with different Z values have correct gradation.
* My triangle OUTLINES that have points with the same Z values have linear gradation.
* My triangle FILLS that have points with the same Z values have linear gradation.
* My triangle FILLS that have points with different Z values have correct gradation.

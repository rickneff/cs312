Assignment 23 - Rotations with Quaternions and Animations
=========================================================
Use quaternions as the way of storing rotations in your transforms.

## Requirements

* Include some method of animation in your scene, perhaps some linear interpolation over time between two XForms.
* Use NLERP (or SLERP if you want to go the extra mile) to interpolate the rotations.
* Refer to [the included example](23) that has a quaternion implementation based on [this excellent reference](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~gewang/projects/darth/stuff/quat_faq.html#Q47).

## Self-Assessment

* I have the previous assignments finished in which I have some representation of a scene graph with nodes that have at least rotation and translation information and which can be parented to another node with rotation and translation.
* My code compiles and runs cleanly.
* My code runs cleanly without errors that I am aware of.
* I have a firm understanding of my code and what it is doing to the degree that I can debug it if something goes wrong.
* I have replaced the Euler angle rotations in my XForm nodes with quaternions.
* I have some method of animating my scene insomuch that I need to do a linear interpolation of my rotations.
* I have implemented a linear interpolation of quaternions using NLERP or SLERP.

## Reference Materials

From our own class, Grant found this link pretty useful: [http://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-advanced-lessons/perspective-and-orthographic-projection-matrix/opengl-perspective-projection-matrix/?](http://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-advanced-lessons/perspective-and-orthographic-projection-matrix/opengl-perspective-projection-matrix/?) Ben Williams found these two helpful links dealing with perspective: [http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/www/tutorial12/tutorial12.html](http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/www/tutorial12/tutorial12.html) and [https://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/showthread.php/153444-perspective-division](https://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/showthread.php/153444-perspective-division).

Coming SOON! Some helpful references found by Brother Pingry along with previous members of the class.
